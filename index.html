  <p>
    Thank you for using SmartPad. This Privacy Policy explains how SmartPad handles your information.

  </p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>

    <li>Notes content, titles, checklist items, and folder organization</li>
    <li>Timestamps such as creation and modification dates</li>
    <li>App preferences such as theme, font size, sorting options, and layout settings</li>

  </ul>

  <p>
    This data remains stored only on your device and is not transmitted to SmartPad servers.

    <li>Creating, editing, deleting, and organizing notes</li>
    <li>Providing search, pinning, and folder management features</li>
    <li>Saving your preferences for a consistent user experience</li>

  <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Your notes are never uploaded to SmartPad servers</li>
    <li>Your data is not shared with advertisers or analytics providers</li>

    <li>You can remove all data by clearing the app’s storage in your device settings</li>
    <li>Uninstalling the app will remove all locally stored app data</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    SmartPad relies on your device’s built-in security protections, including application sandboxing and operating system security controls. 
    We recommend using your device’s screen lock, PIN, or biometric authentication to further protect your data.
  </p>

  <p>
